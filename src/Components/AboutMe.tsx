          Engineering from Spain, with a strong passion for programming and
          design.I'm proficient in several programming languages ðŸ’», and I also
          have hands-on experience with UI/UX design tools like Figma and Adobe
          XD.<br></br>
          <br></br> ðŸŽ¨ In my free time, I love editing videos and creating 3D
          renders using software like Blender & i love make musicðŸŽ¶ <br></br>

          innovate. <br></br>
